# Metro Ticket Purchasing System

A command-line application for purchasing metro tickets with multi-line support, path finding, and transfer station handling.

## Features

- üöá **Multi-line Metro System**: Support for multiple metro lines with transfer stations
- üé´ **Ticket Purchasing**: Buy tickets with unique ID generation
- üó∫Ô∏è **Shortest Path Finding**: Automatic route calculation using BFS algorithm
- üîÑ **Transfer Instructions**: Detailed step-by-step travel instructions including line changes
- üí∞ **Dynamic Pricing**: Ticket price based on number of stations traveled
- üíæ **CSV Storage**: Persistent data storage for stations, lines, connections, and tickets
- üéØ **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean OOP architecture with proper encapsulation

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- No external dependencies (uses only Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
3. No additional packages required

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash

## System Architecture

### Classes

#### `Station`
Represents a metro station that can belong to multiple lines (transfer stations).

**Attributes:**
- `name`: Station name
- `lines`: Set of line IDs this station belongs to
- `connections`: List of connected stations

#### `Line`
Represents a metro line with a color.

**Attributes:**
- `line_id`: Unique line identifier
- `color`: Line color
- `stations`: List of stations on this line

#### `Ticket`
Represents a purchased ticket with travel instructions.

**Attributes:**
- `ticket_id`: Unique ticket ID (UUID)
- `origin`: Origin station
- `destination`: Destination station
- `path`: List of stations in the route
- `price`: Ticket price
- `instructions`: Step-by-step travel instructions

#### `MetroSystem`
Main system class managing the metro network.

**Methods:**
- `add_line()`: Add a metro line
- `find_shortest_path()`: Calculate shortest route using BFS
- `purchase_ticket()`: Purchase a ticket for a route
- `display_stations()`: Show all stations
- `view_tickets()`: Display purchased tickets
- `save_to_csv()` / `load_from_csv()`: Data persistence

## CSV Data Storage

The system uses four CSV files for data persistence:

1. **stations.csv**: Station names and their line associations
2. **lines.csv**: Line IDs and colors
3. **connections.csv**: Station connections (graph edges)
4. **tickets.csv**: Purchase history

## Default Metro Map

The system comes with a default 3-line metro network:

### Red Line
- Central ‚Üí Park ‚Üí Museum ‚Üí Station Square

### Blue Line
- Airport ‚Üí Downtown ‚Üí Museum ‚Üí Port

### Green Line
- University ‚Üí Library ‚Üí Park ‚Üí Stadium

### Transfer Stations
- **Museum**: Red ‚Üî Blue
- **Park**: Red ‚Üî Green

## Pricing

- Base fare: $2.00
- Per station: $0.50
- Formula: `Price = $2.00 + (stations √ó $0.50)`

## Algorithm

The shortest path is calculated using Breadth-First Search (BFS), which guarantees the minimum number of stations between origin and destination.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Graphical visualization with Matplotlib
- [ ] Add more metro lines and stations
- [ ] Real-time train schedules
- [ ] Ticket expiry dates
- [ ] Discount tickets (senior, student)
- [ ] Multiple payment methods
